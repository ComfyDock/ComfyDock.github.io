# ComfyDock Individual Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ComfyDock ("We" or "Us").

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the intellectual property rights You grant to Us when contributing to ComfyDock. This is for Your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of ComfyDock and its users; it does not change Your rights to use Your own Contributions for any other purpose.

## 1. Definitions

**"You"** means the individual who Submits a Contribution to Us.

**"Contribution"** means any work of authorship, including the original version of the work and any modifications or additions to that work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally Submitted by You to Us for inclusion in, or documentation of, ComfyDock. For the purposes of this definition, **"Submit"** means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Us or Our representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems.

**"Material"** means the work of authorship which is made available by Us to third parties. When this Agreement covers more than one software project, the Material means the work of authorship to which the Contribution was Submitted.

## 2. Grant of Rights

### 2.1 Copyright License

You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to:

(a) reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute Your Contribution and such derivative works; and

(b) sublicense the foregoing rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees.

### 2.2 Patent License

You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer Your Contribution, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution alone or by combination of Your Contribution with the Material to which such Contribution was Submitted.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Material to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Material shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

### 2.3 Outbound License

**ComfyDock is dual-licensed:**
- GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0) for open-source use
- Commercial proprietary licenses for businesses requiring non-copyleft terms

Based on the grant of rights in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, if We include Your Contribution in a Material, We may license the Contribution under any license, including copyleft, permissive, commercial, or proprietary licenses.

**However,** if We license Your Contribution under terms other than AGPL-3.0, We agree to also make it available under the AGPL-3.0 license.

### 2.4 Moral Rights

If moral rights apply to Your Contribution, to the maximum extent permitted by law, You waive and agree not to assert such moral rights against Us or Our successors in interest, or any of Our licensees, either direct or indirect.

## 3. Your Representations

You represent that:

(a) You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to Us, or that Your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with Us.

(b) Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see Section 4 for submissions on behalf of others).

(c) Your Contribution submission includes complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which You are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

## 4. Third-Party Content

Should You wish to Submit work that is not Your original creation, You may Submit it to Us separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

## 5. No Support Obligation

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## 6. Notification of Changes

You agree to notify Us of any facts or circumstances of which You become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

- Your Contributions will be available under the AGPL-3.0 license
