# Installation

ComfyDock can be installed in two different ways: directly using the CLI tool or through the Pinokio app platform. Choose the method that works best for your workflow.

### **Prerequisites**

- A **Windows, Linux, or macOS** machine (macOS is CPU-only)
- **Docker**: ComfyDock requires Docker to be installed on your system
    - For desktop environments: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)  for Windows, macOS, or Linux
    - For headless environments: [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) + [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)
- Latest **WSL** (Windows only).
- Latest **NVIDIA drivers**.
- Adequate disk space.

### **Installing Docker Desktop**

1. Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). (AMD64 recommended)
2. Follow installation instructions for your operating system.
3. (Optional step: Windows) Ensure WSL is updated:
    - Open PowerShell as Administrator.
    - Run the following command:
        
        ```
        wsl --update
        ```
        
    - Verify Docker installation by running:
        
        ```
        wsl docker --version
        ```
    
    If successful, you'll see output like: `Docker version 27.3.1, build ce12230`.
